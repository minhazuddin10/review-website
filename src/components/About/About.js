      <h2>Education About</h2>
      <p>
        Education is a process of learning through which we acquire knowledge.
        It enlightens, empowers, and creates a positive development. Education
        gives an individual the knowledge and skills to work with virtue. It
        aids the all-round mental, physical, and intellectual growth and
        development of an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three distinct types of Education- Formal Education,
        Non-Formal Education, and Informal Education. Education aims to change
        the way of oneâ€™s thinking. Academic knowledge provides one leaning on a
        global scale, while Practical knowledge is acquired for life on the
        whole.
